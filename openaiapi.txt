Images
Given a prompt and/or an input image, the model will generate a new image. Related guide: Image generation
Create image
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations
Creates an image given a prompt. Learn more.

Request body
prompt
string
Required
A text description of the desired image(s). The maximum length is 32000 characters for the GPT image models, 1000 characters for dall-e-2 and 4000 characters for dall-e-3.
background
string or null
Optional
Defaults to auto
Allows to set transparency for the background of the generated image(s). This parameter is only supported for the GPT image models. Must be one of transparent, opaque or auto (default value). When auto is used, the model will automatically determine the best background for the image.

If transparent, the output format needs to support transparency, so it should be set to either png (default value) or webp.
model
string
Optional
Defaults to dall-e-2
The model to use for image generation. One of dall-e-2, dall-e-3, or a GPT image model (gpt-image-1, gpt-image-1-mini, gpt-image-1.5). Defaults to dall-e-2 unless a parameter specific to the GPT image models is used.
moderation
string or null
Optional
Defaults to auto
Control the content-moderation level for images generated by the GPT image models. Must be either low for less restrictive filtering or auto (default value).
n
integer or null
Optional
Defaults to 1
The number of images to generate. Must be between 1 and 10. For dall-e-3, only n=1 is supported.
output_compression
integer or null
Optional
Defaults to 100
The compression level (0-100%) for the generated images. This parameter is only supported for the GPT image models with the webp or jpeg output formats, and defaults to 100.
output_format
string or null
Optional
Defaults to png
The format in which the generated images are returned. This parameter is only supported for the GPT image models. Must be one of png, jpeg, or webp.
partial_images
integer
Optional
Defaults to 0
The number of partial images to generate. This parameter is used for streaming responses that return partial images. Value must be between 0 and 3. When set to 0, the response will be a single image sent in one streaming event.

Note that the final image may be sent before the full number of partial images are generated if the full image is generated more quickly.
quality
string or null
Optional
Defaults to auto
The quality of the image that will be generated.

auto (default value) will automatically select the best quality for the given model.
high, medium and low are supported for the GPT image models.
hd and standard are supported for dall-e-3.
standard is the only option for dall-e-2.
response_format
string or null
Optional
Defaults to url
The format in which generated images with dall-e-2 and dall-e-3 are returned. Must be one of url or b64_json. URLs are only valid for 60 minutes after the image has been generated. This parameter isn't supported for the GPT image models, which always return base64-encoded images.
size
string or null
Optional
Defaults to auto
The size of the generated images. Must be one of 1024x1024, 1536x1024 (landscape), 1024x1536 (portrait), or auto (default value) for the GPT image models, one of 256x256, 512x512, or 1024x1024 for dall-e-2, and one of 1024x1024, 1792x1024, or 1024x1792 for dall-e-3.
stream
boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to false
Generate the image in streaming mode. Defaults to false. See the Image generation guide for more information. This parameter is only supported for the GPT image models.
style
string or null
Optional
Defaults to vivid
The style of the generated images. This parameter is only supported for dall-e-3. Must be one of vivid or natural. Vivid causes the model to lean towards generating hyper-real and dramatic images. Natural causes the model to produce more natural, less hyper-real looking images.
user
string
Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.
Returns
Returns an image object.

Request body
image
string or array
Required
The image(s) to edit. Must be a supported image file or an array of images.

For the GPT image models (gpt-image-1, gpt-image-1-mini, and gpt-image-1.5), each image should be a png, webp, or jpg file less than 50MB. You can provide up to 16 images.

For dall-e-2, you can only provide one image, and it should be a square png file less than 4MB.

background
string or null
Optional
Defaults to auto
Allows to set transparency for the background of the generated image(s). This parameter is only supported for the GPT image models. Must be one of transparent, opaque or auto (default value). When auto is used, the model will automatically determine the best background for the image.

If transparent, the output format needs to support transparency, so it should be set to either png (default value) or webp.
